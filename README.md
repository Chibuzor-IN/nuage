# Install
Nuage is a react app with node in the backend. Installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/mickael-kerjean/nuage
cd nuage
npm install
npm run build
node server/index.js
```

Or with [docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/machines/nuage/) and [Docker compose](https://github.com/mickael-kerjean/nuage/blob/master/docker/docker-compose.yml)

# What about my credentials?
Credentials are stored in your browser in a http only cookie encrypted using aes-256-cbc and aren't persistent in the server disk at all.
The "remember me" feature relies on localstorage to store your credentials encrypted using aes-256-cbc.

Note that on the FTP and sFTP, sessions connections aren't destroyed on every request but are reused and killed after 2 minutes. The reasoning is connections are expensive to create and this trick make the entire application feel much much faster for users who tries to navigate.
